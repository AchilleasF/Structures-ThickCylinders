## Abstract
This repository accompanies the article _Selected closed-form algebraic solutions for linear stress and buckling analyses of elastic shear-flexible axisymmetric cylindrical shells_ by the present authors, including resources for the reproduction of figures and more.

## Requirenments
A Microsoft 365 license is required to run the Excel spreadsheet for the stress analysis of cylinders under a uniform meridional edge load and/or normal pressure.

A Python installation is required to run the corresponding scripts attached. The following packages need to be installed:
-numpy
-cmath
-pandas
-matplotlib

## Usage
The Excel spreadsheet and the Python scripts for the stress analysis of cylindrical shells are ready to explore as independent files.
Python scripts for the evaluation of elastic bifurcation buckling loads under meridional compression or uniform external pressure are provided in the form of callable functions, requiring the programming of a master script to be called from.
